# Plane & Simple / Travel Tracker

The final solo project of module 2 at Turing, We were told to create a website for a travel agency. The first thing we had to do was create a login for 50 travelers and a agent. These dashboards were unique based upon which user logged in. The traveler needed to be able to book a request with a book trip form. This sent a fetch/POST request to the API created bu the instructors. We also wanted to be able to display some information the user might be interested in. The agent was similar, however they needed to be able to search for users, approve/deny requests.
